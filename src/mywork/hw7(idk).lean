Define relation, r, as two-place predicate on 
a type, β, with notation, x ≺ y, for (r x y). 
-/
variables {α β : Type}  (r : β → β → Prop)
local infix `≺`:50 := r  
-- Strangely Lean's library does define asymmetric, so here it is.
def asymmetric := ∀ ⦃x y⦄, x ≺ y → ¬ y ≺ x



-- Prove both formally and in English.
example : ( ∃ (x y : β), r x y) → asymmetric r → ¬reflexive r :=

if a relation is asymmetric, then it is not reflexive
asymmetric: for all x,y, if x relates to y, then y does not relate to x
example: x < y

antisymmetric: if x relates to y, y can relate to x if they are equal????
example: x ≤ y

when r is a relation over an empty set, there is a contradiction

Logic, like programming, is subtle. It's very easy for humans
to miss subtle corner cases. As an example, today I ran across
a problem in a textbook by Paul Traiger, a professor emeritus
of philosophy and cognitive science at Occidental College. He
asks students to prove that if a relation is both transitive and 
reflexive that it cannot be anti-symmetric. Is it actually true?
If not, what condition needs to be added to make it true? See
https://sites.oxy.edu/traiger/logic/exercises/chapter13/properties_of_relations_exercise.html

example : ( ∃ (b : β), true) → transitive r → reflexive r → ¬ asymmetric r :=
begin
  unfold transitive,
  unfold reflexive,
  unfold asymmetric,

  assume b,
  assume trans,
  assume refl,
  assume asymm,

  cases b with b tru, 

  have rbb := refl b,
  have nrbb := asymm rbb,
  contradiction,

State and prove that the subset relation on the powerset of any
set, s, is antisymmetric. Formally state and prove, and then give
an informal proof, of this proposition. You may use the following
formal definition of the powerset of a given set, s. 
-/

def powerset (s : set β) := { s' | s' ⊆ s}

example : ∀ (s : set β) 
            (s1 s2 ∈ powerset s), 
            s1 ⊆ s2 → 
            s2 ⊆ s1 → 
            s1 = s2 :=
begin
  assume s s1 s2,
  assume s1es s2es,
  assume s1es2,
  assume s2es1,
  
  apply set.ext,
  assume x,
  split,
  
  assume xes1,
  apply s1es2 xes1,
  assume xes2,
  apply s2es1 xes2,

Given two natural numbers, n and m, we will say that m divides n
if there is a natural number, k, such that n = k*m. Here's a formal
definition of this relation.
-/

def divides (m n : ℕ) := ∃ k, n = k * m

#3: Formally state and prove each of the following propositions.
Remember that the ring tactic is useful for producing proofs of
algebraic equalities involving + and *. You can use the phrase,
"by basic algebra" when translating the use of this tactic into
English.
-/

-- 3a: For any n, 1 divides n.

example : ∀ n, divides 1 n :=
begin
end

-- 3b. For any n, n divides n

example : ∀ n, divides n n :=
begin
end

-- #3c. divides is reflexive (use our reflexive predicate)

example : reflexive divides :=
begin
end 

-- #3d. divides is transitive

example : ∀ h n k, divides h n → divides n k → divides h k :=
begin
end 

/- 
#3d. is divides symmetric? if yes, give a proof, otherwise 
give a counterexample and a brief explanation to show that 
it's not.

-- Answer here

/- 
#3e. Prove that divides is antisymmetric. Use the
anti_symmetric predicate to state the proposition
formally.
-/
example : relations.anti_symmetric divides := 
begin
  unfold relations.anti_symmetric divides,
  assume x y kx ky,
  cases kx with kxv kxpf,
  cases ky with kyv kypf,
  rw kxpf at kypf,
  /-
  From kypf we can deduce by basic algebra
  that kyv = kxv = 1, and the rewriting kxv
  as 1 in kxpf, we get that y = x. The proof
  of the conclusion then follows by symmetry
  of equality. We don't yet quite have the
  tools to reason formally to the conlusion
  that kxv and kyv are both one, so we'll 
  just admit it as an axiom for now, using
  sorry to remind us to come back and visit
  this point again when we're equipped to 
  polish off the formal proof.
